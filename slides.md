# Functional Programming in TypeScript

- From Mathematical Concept
- Over Haskell
- To TypeScript

---

# Agenda

- What is Functional Programming (concept overview)
- Mathematical roots (functions, composition, purity)
- Haskell as a “pure model”
- TypeScript applied examples
- Hands-on exercises throughout

---

# Function Programming Definition

- Immutable Data
- Pure Functions
  - No State (Output depends on Input and internal Algo)
  - No Side Effects (No Read or Write to outside World)

---

# Warm-Up: What is Functional Programming?

- When does debugging become painful in large TS projects?
- What makes code hard to reason about?
- Have you used map/filter/reduce?

---

- side effects
- hidden state
- unclear data flow
- mutation

## 📌 Core idea

**Functional Programming = programming with mathematics as the design language.**
You transform values with functions, avoid surprises, and keep everything explicit.

---

# 2. Math Foundations

## 2.1 What is a function?

A function is:

- a mapping from inputs to outputs,
- deterministic: `f(x)` always returns the same `y`,
- total: defined for all valid inputs (we’ll relax this later).

**Example:**
`f(x) = x + 1`

---

**👥 Micro-exercise 1:**
Is this a function in the mathematical sense?

- `g(x) = random number`
- `h(x) = 1 / x`

Discuss determinism + domain problems (Option, Maybe, ...).

---

## 2.2 Composition

Mathematically:

```
(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))
```

### Demonstrate

```
g(x) = x * 2
f(x) = x + 1

(f ∘ g)(3) = f(g(3)) = f(6) = 7
```

---

👥 **Micro-exercise 2:**
Given
`a(x)=x−3` and `b(x)=x²`
What is `(a ∘ b)(4)`?

---

## 2.3 Purity & Referential Transparency

### Definition

A function is **pure** if:

- same inputs → same output
- no side effects (no I/O, no mutation, no random, no time, no state)

---

### Show non-pure JS example

```ts
let counter = 0;
function inc() {
  return counter++;
}
```

Show pure version:

```ts
const inc = (x: number) => x + 1;
```

### Why it matters

- predictable
- testable
- composable
- no hidden surprises

---

👥 **Micro-exercise 3:**
Which of these is pure?

```ts
const a = (x: number) => x * x;
const b = (x: string) => {
  console.log(x);
  return x;
};
const c = (x: string) => Date.now();
```

---

## 2.4 Higher-Order Functions

A function that takes functions as arguments or returns functions.

**Example:**

```js
const apply = (f) => (x) => f(x);
```

```ts
const apply =
  <A, B>(f: (x: A) => B) =>
  (x: A): B =>
    f(x);
```

```ts
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;
const result = apply(double)(5); // 10
```

---

# 3. Haskell as a Model of Pure FP

Explain why Haskell is useful:

- everything is pure
- types guide reasoning
- mathematical feel

No need to know syntax; show how FP looks _clean_

---

## 3.1 Basic Haskell functions

```haskell
add1 x = x + 1
double x = x * 2
```

Composition:

```haskell
f = add1 . double
```

Demonstrate and try in GHCI:

```haskell
f 3
-- 7
```

---

## 3.2 Immutability

In Haskell:

```haskell
x = 3
y = x + 1
```

Variables cannot be reassigned.

- reasoning becomes algebraic.

---

## 3.3 Type signatures

```haskell
add1 :: Int -> Int
add1 x = x + 1
```

You can treat the type like a function arrow.

---

## 3.4 Pattern matching & recursion

```haskell
fact 0 = 1
fact n = n * fact (n - 1)
```

Why this is pure?
How to do a pure loop?

---

Because recursion is just mathematical induction.

👥 **Exercise 4:**
Write a pure function of your own in Haskell syntax:

```
square x = ?
```

---

---

# **4. Going from Haskell to TypeScript (30 min)**

Show how the same ideas exist in TS, even if the language is not pure.

---

## **4.1 Pure functions in TS (5 min)**

```ts
const add1 = (x: number): number => x + 1;
const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const f = (x: number) => add1(double(x));
```

---

## **4.2 Higher-order functions in TS (10 min)**

### Example: function factory

```ts
const makeAdder = (a: number) => (b: number) => a + b;
const add5 = makeAdder(5);
add5(3); // 8
```

👥 **Exercise 5:**
Write a HOF:

```
const applyTwice = ???;
```

---

## **4.3 map/filter/reduce as composition (10 min)**

Tie it back to mathematics:

```ts
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const result = nums
  .map((x) => x + 1)
  .filter((x) => x % 2 === 0)
  .reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);
```

Ask: why is this easy to reason about?
Because each step is _pure_ and _composable_.

---

## **4.4 Immutability in JS/TS (5 min)**

```
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4];
```

Show how to avoid mutation traps.

---

# **5. Mini-Workshop: Build a Pure Pipeline (20 min)**

### 🛠️ Task

Given a list of numbers:

1. Remove odd numbers
2. Square the even numbers
3. Sum them
4. Keep everything pure

### Haskell version (show)

```haskell
pipeline xs = sum (map (^2) (filter even xs))
```

### TypeScript version (let the audience build it)

```ts
const pipeline = (xs: number[]) =>
  xs
    .filter((x) => x % 2 === 0)
    .map((x) => x * x)
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```

👥 **Exercise 6:** Participants adapt it to:

- cube instead of square
- drop numbers < 10

---

# **6. Summary & Q&A (5 min)**

### 🎯 Key takeaways

- FP is just doing programming like math: pure, predictable, composable.
- Haskell gives us the purest view of FP.
- TypeScript lets us apply FP principles in real-world apps.

---

# **7. Optional Homework**

1. Rewrite 5 small functions in TS to be pure.
2. Implement your own `compose` function:

```ts
const compose =
  <A, B, C>(f: (b: B) => C, g: (a: A) => B) =>
  (a: A) =>
    f(g(a));
```

3. Look up: What is a functor?
